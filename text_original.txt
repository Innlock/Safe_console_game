DO YOU WANT DIRECTIONS? 

YOU ARE A BURGULAR AND HAVE ENCOUNTERED A SAFE.  YOU  MUST
OPEN THE SAFE TO GET THE SECRET PLANS THAT YOU CAME FOR.
TO DO THIS , YOU MUST ENTER THE NUMBER OF WHAT YOU WANT THE
 DIAL TURNED TO, THE COMPUTER WILL ACT AS THE SAFE AND WILL
HELP YOU BY GIVING A SORT OF CLUE, THAT IS YOU WILL'HEAR'
A CLICK AT EVENLY SPACED NOTCHES AS YOU MOVE TO THE PROPER
NUMBER.  THERE ARE FOUR OF THEM BEFORE THE FINAL CLICK IS
'HEARD'. AFTER THE FINAL ONE IS HEARD, YOU WILL GO ON TO
THE NEXT NUMBER. THE COMPUTER WILL'SAY' 'CLICK' FOR EACH
NOTCH THAT YOU PASS AND '**CLICK**' WHEN YOU REACH THE
PROPER NUMBER.  IF YOU PASS IT OR TAKE LONGER THAN TEN TRIES
ON ANY ONE NUMBER, YOU WILL ACTIVATE THE ALARM.
